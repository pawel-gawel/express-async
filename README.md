## Express Async

Example how to run Express with async routes + wrapper for async functions so you wolud not have to put everything in try/catch block.

### Run

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Async route callbacks

One can actually pass it to express as-is, but could also wrap it with `async-wrapper` for easy error handling (see `async-routes.js`)
